# Part 1. A preliminary training

*Do not use R (RStudio) to solve problems in Part 1.*

## Problem 1

Look at the following histogram and answer the questions.

### 1.1
What is the proportion of values in the sample that exceed $5$? Explain your answer.

_Your answer and explanation here_
($4$ values from $5$ to $10$) + ($1$ value from $15$ to $20$) = $5$ values that exceed $5$.
Number of all values: $1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20$.
$5/20 = 1/4$, or $25%$ of the values exceed $5$.

### 1.2
Indicate the interval where the median of this sample can lie. Explain your answer.

_Your answer and explanation here_
There are $20$ values, so the median is $(x_10 + x_11)/2$. Both $x_10$ and $x_11$ lie in the $[-5,0]$ interval, so the median will also be in that interval.

### 1.3

How the histogram will change if we add an element $7$ to the sample? Explain your answer.

_Your answer and explanation here_
The column $[5,10]$ will become higher by $1$ ($7$ lies in $[5,10]$ interval, and it is one value).

## Problem 2

### 2.1
Look at the histograms of two samples. They illustrate the distribution of normalized average reaction time to frequent words (in ms) in two groups of people.



Which of the samples has a larger variance? Explain your answer.

_Your answer and explanation here_
$var(sample_1) > var(sample_2)$, because $sample_1$ histogram is wider, that means $max(x_average - x_i)$ is larger. $Sample_1$ also has higher frequencies near $400$ and $600$ values.
\newpage

### 2.2

Look at the histograms of two samples.


Which of the samples has a larger variance? Explain your answer.

_Your answer and explanation here_
Columns' heights are distributed more or less in the same way, but maximum deviation in sample 2 is 2, and in sample 1 is about 10. Also sample 1 has more values on the right edge of the histogram, so var(sample1) > var(sample2). 

## Problem 3

Below is the histogram of the number of mistakes students made while writing an examination essay in English. Look at the histogram and answer the questions.


### 3.1
Is it true that $50$% students made more than $35$ mistakes?

Explain your answer below.

_Your answer and explanation here_
No, most part of all values is before $35$.

### 3.2
Is it true that most students made no more than $10$ mistakes?

Explain your answer below.

_Your answer and explanation here_
No, it seems there more students who made $10$ to $40$ mistakes.

### 3.3
Which of the following values is closer to the median of `mistakes`: $10$, $20$, $30$, $40$?

Explain your answer below.

_Your answer and explanation here_
$20$. Frequencies start to decrease at about $25$, and the median should be somewhere near the maximum frequency.

# Part 2. Exact binomial test

## Problem 4. Type I and type II errors
A magician claims that he can predict the future. To test his abilities, the
following experiment is conducted. A fair coin is tossed several times, every
time magician tries to guess the outcome before he can see it. Sometimes his
guess is correct, sometimes it is not. We allow for the magician to make
mistakes from time to time (nobody is perfect, even magicians).

We toss a coin $n$ times and denote number of correct guesses by $X$. If $X$ is
large enough, we say that the magician proved that he has paranormal abilities.
Otherwise, we say he didn't prove it.

Denote probability that magician guesses the result of one coin-tossing by $p$.
Then our hypotheses are as follows:

- $H_0\colon p=1/2$ (i.e. random guessing occurs)
- $H_1\colon p>1/2$ (i.e. the magician's guessing abilities are better than
  random guess, though probably not perfect)

### 4.1

Assume that the magician cannot predict future, thus $H_0$ holds true (but we
don't know it). We conduct an experiment as follows. We toss a fair coin three
times, i.e.  $n=3$. If he guesses correctly results of all three tossings, i.e.
$X=3$, we conclude he can predict future. Otherwise, we say that we don't have
enough evidence to claim the magician predict future.

#### 4.1.1

How likely we will claim that the magician can predict future? Find exact
probability.

_Your answer and explanation here_
$1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/8$

#### 4.1.2

How likely we will say that we don't have enough evidence to claim the
magician predict future. Find exact probability.

_Your answer and explanation here_
$1-1/8 = 7/8$.
The same answer we can get, if we sum up probabilities to guess $2$ out of $3$ tossings, $1$ out of $3$, and $0$ out of $3$: $3/8+3/8+1/8=7/8$. 

#### 4.1.3

Consider outcomes that happen in 4.1.1 and 4.1.2. Which of them constitute type I error? Type II error?

_Your answer and explanation here_
In 4.1.1 we found probability to reject $H_0$ provived that $H_0$ holds - this is type I error.
4.1.2 constitutes type II error, exept for $p=1/2$ there, and in type II error it should be $>1/2$.

#### 4.1.4

Find probability to make type I error. Type II error.

_Your answer and explanation here_
$p(type_I)=1/2*1/2*1/2=1/8$.
If we assume $H_0$ holds true, there cannot be type II error, $p=0$.
If the person is a magician, the probability to call him a lier is $1-p_0^3$, where $1/2<p_0<=1$ - his probability to predict future.
### 4.2

Assume that the magician can predict future, namely, his actual probability to correctly guess the result of one tossing is $2/3$. Solve problem 4.1 under this new
assumption. Highlight the differences between two settings.

_Your answer and explanation here_
4.2.1 $2/3*2/3*2/3=8/27~0.3$
4.2.2 $1-8/27=19/27~0.7$
4.2.3 $p(type_I)= p(reject H_0| H_0 holds)= 1/8$, cause the procedure stays the same as in 4.1 
$p(type_II)= p(magician guesses <3 tossings)= 1-(2/3)^3~0.7$.


## Problem 5. p-value
Assume that the magician from the previous problem cannot guess future. Let
$n=11$, i.e. we toss a coin 11 times.  We claim the magician can predict future
(i.e. reject $H_0$)
if the number of correct guesses $X$ is as large as some predefined number
$X_{crit}$.

_Your answer and explanation here_

### 5.1

Let $X_{crit}=11$, i.e. we need to have 11 correct guesses out of 11 to claim
that the magician can predict future. What is probability to make Type I error
in this case?

_Your answer and explanation here_
$p(type_I)=(1/2)^11=1/2048~0,0005$

### 5.2

Let $X_{crit}=10$, i.e. we need to have at least 10 correct guesses out of 11 to claim
that the magician can predict future. What is probability to make Type I error
in this case? You can use function `pbinom` to find answer.

_Your answer and explanation here_
> sum(dbinom(10:11,11,0.5))
[1] 0.005859375 
or
$11/2048+1/2048=12/2048~0,006$

### 5.3

Find the smallest integer number such that if $X_{crit}$ is equal to that
number, the probability to make Type I error is smaller than the significance
level $0.05$.

_Your answer and explanation here_
binom.test(7, 11, p=0.5, alternative="greater")
binom.test(8, 11, p=0.5, alternative="greater")
binom.test(9, 11, p=0.5, alternative="greater")
We get p-value<$0.05$ starting with $X_{crit}$=9.

### 5.4

Assume that we obtained $X_{obs}$ correct guesses out of 11. We don't know
$X_{obs}$, but we know that the corresponding p-value (i.e. probability to
obtain $X_{obs}$ correct guesses or more provided that null hypothesis holds) is
less than $0.01$. Can you conclude, without finding exact value of $X_{obs}$,
which value is larger: $X_{obs}$ or the value for $X_{crit}$ that you found in 5.3? Use to explain your answer.

_Your answer and explanation here_
$X_{obs}$>$X_{crit}$, because p-value($X_{obs})<p-value($X_{crit}$) <=> p-value($X_{obs})<$0.01$<p-value($X_{crit}$)<$0.05$.
### 5.5

Assume we actually obtained 7 correct guesses out of 11. Find p-value, i.e.
probability to obtain 7 correct guesses or more provided that null hypothesis
holds true.

_Your answer and explanation here_
> sum(dbinom(7:11,11,0.5))
[1] 0.2744141
or
> binom.test(7, 11, p=0.5, alternative="greater")
p-value = 0.2744

### Problem 5. Exact binomial test

In a certain language there are two forms of a word "go": normal and
dialectical. Whe know that if we select random person from the Country, this
person will use normal form with probability 2/3 and dialectical form with
probability 1/3. (One person uses only one form all the time.) Researcher
suggests that the percentage of people who use dialectical form in a particular
City is higher than in the Country. To prove this point, she proceed with the
following experiment. Random person from the City is selected and his/her usage
of word "go" is recorded. This is repeated $n$ times (the same person
theoretically can be chosen more than one time, but the City is large
comparatively to $n$, so it rarely occurs in practice).

The results are as following: 20 informants where selected ($n=20$), 17 of them
use dialectical form.

Is it enough to say that the percentage of people who use dialectical form in
the City is higher than in the Country?

#### 5.1 Hypothesis

Denote the probability that randomly selected person from the City uses
dialectical form by $p$.  State the null hypothesis and alternative.

- $H_0$: $p_{City}(dialectal)=p_{Country}(dialectal)=2/3$
- $H_1$: p_{City}(dialectal)>p_{Country}(dialectal)$


#### 5.2 Find p-value

Recall that p-value is a probability to get the data that we obtained or "more
extreme" (more convincing to reject null hypothesis in favor of alternative)
provided that null hypothesis holds. Find p-value for your data.

_Your answer and explanation here_
> binom.test(17, 20, p=2/3, alternative="greater")

	Exact binomial test

data:  17 and 20
number of successes = 17, number of trials = 20,
p-value = 0.06045


#### 5.3 Conclusion

Will you reject null hypothesis? Use significance level of 5%.

_Your answer and explanation here_
p-value>$0.05$, so I will reject null hypothesis.

alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.6666667
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.6563362 1.0000000
sample estimates:
probability of success 
                  0.85 

#### 5.4 Answer
Can we claim that we have enough evidence to say that the percentage of people who use dialectical form in the City is higher than in the Country?

_Your answer and explanation here_
Yes, our sample shows that the percentage of people who use dialectical form in the City is higher than in the Country at significance level of 5%.
